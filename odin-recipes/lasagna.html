        <strong>Directions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Step 1
        In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, 
        and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir 
        in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and 
        water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, 
        Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 
        tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, 
        stirring occasionally.
        </p>
        <p>
        Step 2
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
        Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
        Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing 
        bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, 
        and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </p>
        <p>
        Step 3
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </p>
        <p>
        Step 4
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the 
        bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
        lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of 
        the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of 
        mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce 
        over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan 
        cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella 
        and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
        either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the 
        foil does not touch the cheese.
        </p>
        <p>
        Step 5
        Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, 
        and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes 
        before serving.
